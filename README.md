# Week-13-Moringa-Datascience-Core-IP
This is my submission for week 13 in Moringa School.
During this week we were tasked to utilize the skills learnt on supervised and unsupervised learning using R.
We were supposed to utilize these skills in two scenarios:
Scenario 1:Apply Supervised learning to:A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 
Scenario 2: Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

            Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
            Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis. 

Your findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand. 
I therefore went ahead to undertake the project as shown in the two notebooks,enjoy your read.
